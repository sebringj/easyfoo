# EasyFoo

CMS completely reimagined

## WTF another CMS?
EasyFoo is different because its focus is on being an API first, consumable in any technology with an optional front-end JavaScript plugin to enable editing directly on web pages.

This idea spawned out of a need to quickly build websites in any server-side technology that can pull in JSON feeds from an always-on CDN.

The creator of KitGUI has come together with Sebring Creative to offer an open source version completely rebuilt from the ground up on Node.js, MongoDB and client-side JavaScript. The idea has been battle tested in hundreds of production websites. 

## Consumable on Websites and Apps

EasyFoo doesn't care where you serve your content because its just JSON feeds.

## Quickly create new editor types

Use JSON to specify your editor for different types of content. Edit a collection or a single item.

## Multiple Users

We've got a nice way to invite others through invitations using oauth 2.0.

## Multi-tennant

An account holds all the content for a given set of users and you can add as many accounts as you like.

## Versioning built in

Don't worry if you shit the bed. You've got versions, hun.

## Batches too, Biyatch

Want to serve that holiday greeting around the right time or launch that product campaign between here and there. You got it, bro.

Don't make it hard. Make it easy, foo.
